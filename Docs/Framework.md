# Framework (ECS-hybrid)

## Architecture

The engine is organized into a simple hierarchy:

```
Main
└── Engine
    ├── Modules
    │   └── Systems
    └── World
        ├── Systems
        └── Entities
                └── Components
```

## Main

The application's entry point.

Its only responsibility is to create and run the **Engine**.

---

## Engine

The central object of the framework.

It owns and updates:

* The **World**
* All **Modules**

The engine is responsible for driving the application's lifecycle (startup, update loop, rendering, shutdown).

---

## Modules

Modules are large, self-contained parts of the engine.

Examples include:

* Renderer
* Input
* Physics
* Audio
* Networking

Each module owns one or more **Systems**. The module handles the lifecycle of all related **Systems**.

It can also contain **Resources**, premade **Entities** & **Components** (in the folder hierarchy)

---

## Systems

Systems contain behavior and logic.

They perform work every frame, either independently or by operating on entities and their components.

Examples include:

* Camera System
* Transform System

---

## World

The world owns every entity in the application.

It is responsible for creating, storing & removing entities.

---

## Entities

Entities are lightweight objects.

An entity is simply:

* A unique ID
* Ids of children and parent

Entities contain no game logic.

---

## Components

Components are pure data blocks.

They describe an entity's properties without containing behavior.

Examples include:

* TransformComponent
* MeshComponent
* MaterialComponent
* CameraComponent
* LightComponent

Systems read and modify component data to produce behavior.

---

## Design Philosophy

The framework follows a component-based architecture:

* **Modules** organize major engine features.
* **Systems** implement behavior.
* **Worlds** manage entities.
* **Entities** group components.
* **Components** store data only.

This separation keeps data independent of behavior while making systems reusable and easy to extend.
